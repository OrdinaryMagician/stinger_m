## In progress

 - N/A, this is the 1.1.4 release.

## Planned

 - Shifted to a 1.2 update:
   - Extension to the Translator so it can show item descriptions and whatnot when picking them up. Give it some usability for normal gameplay. Could eventually extend it further to make it more like Serious Sam's NETRICSA.
   - Impaler "slice" animation for melee alt.
   - Alternate flamethrower secondary that behaves more like the Unreal Bible describes (unlit blobs at a rate of 4 per second that catch on fire with explosions/lava/etc).
   - Alternate Impaler primary that follows the Bible (laser shots from the crystal), shifts crystal shooting to pressing both buttons at once.
   - Actual Bonesaw?
   - Implement ASMD behavior described in the Unreal novels (highly destructive green beam that bounces off mirrors and water).
   - Redo Quadshot animations (including partial reloads).
